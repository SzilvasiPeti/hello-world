Hello Coders!

My name is Peter Szilvasi. I come from Hungary, and I live in a medium-sized city. I study at Miskolc university, I am informatic engineer. I am learning web-development (front-end + back-end), java programming language, C, and so on. I would like to learn more about informatic. My hobbies are tennis, chess, wall-climbing, playing guitar.

Let's code! :D
